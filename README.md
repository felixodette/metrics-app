# React Based Weather App
This educational project is to bulid a mobile web app to check a list of metrics using React and Redux.
An API that provides numeric data about a chosen topic is selected, and an app built around it. The app has 3 pages:
- `Home` with a list of countries that can be filtered by region
- `Cities` page with a list of cities for the selected country
- `Details` page with the weather details. 
The app gets the data from the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) api.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
